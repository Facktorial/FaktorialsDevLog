You obviously know the feeling that you should be doing something more important, but you can't help yourself and you have to listen to your heart. (If not, you wouldn't be here reading this vomit.)

Recently (~1yr ago) I started with orienteeting, and now I am in stage of wannabe better o-runner. One way to achieve it is to get hands on difficult events, gain experiences. Sometimes one is forced to choose the right class of race. Better classes offer more ranking points to acquire, also it makes harder to achieve any (better competition). Worse classes got easier and shorter course, fewer points to acquire, but it's easier to get them.
The problem is that, when runner is choosing which class to participate in, the following often happens: young, agile, really solid orienteer is moved to lower class, because he is not in rankings high enough. Participating in lower class merges cons of both choices. (And u're typically moved down as well.) So in my experience I am focused on getting points. (see above and I am also competitive, disclaimer: this approach leads to disappointment often).

So, what did I do again? I told to myself: even though there are more important things I should be focusing on (as foreshadowed), I did something unnecessary, but I had to do it. I wrote web app that scrapes and visualize data from the ORIS portal (Czech portal for orienteering events). Another thing I did again was trying to solve problem-which is definitely not good idea to trying solving it with Haskell, with Haskell. (Also did again).

The Afternoon project is done after week or so. Nice. At least I know, **[Jsou tam body](https://github.com/Facktorial/jsou-tam-body)**...
