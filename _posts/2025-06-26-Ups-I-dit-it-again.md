You obviously knows feeling, that you should do something more important, but you can't help yourself and you have to listen to your heart. (If not, you wouldn't be here reading this vomit.)

Recently (~1yr ago) i started with Orienteeting, and now I am in stage of wannabe better. One way to achieve it is get hands on difficult events, get experiences. Sometime is man forced to choose right class of race. Better classes got more ranking points to acquire, also it makes harder to achieve any (better competition). Worse classes got easier and shorter track, less points to acquire, but its easier to get them.
Problem is that, when runner is choosing which class participate, it often happens following: young, agile, really solid orienteer is moved to lower class, because he is not in rankings high enough. Then participate in lower class merges cons of both choices. (And u typically moved down as well.) So in my experience I am focused on getting points. (see above and I am also competitive, disclaimer: this approach leads to disappointment often).

So, what I did again. I said to myself, even though there are more important things I should focus on (foreshadowed), I did something unnecessary, but I had to do it. I wrote Webapp scraping data from ORIS portal (Czech portal for orienteering events). Another thing, I did again was trying to solve problem, what is not good idea to trying solving it with Haskell, with Haskell. (Also did again).

Project for afternoon is done after week or so. Nice. At least I know, **[Jsou tam body](https://github.com/Facktorial/jsou-tam-body)**...
