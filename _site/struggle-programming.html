  <h1>Hmmm, typical workflow, oh shiiiit, here we go again...</h1>

  <p>Let’s say, we are working hard<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> on finishing our third custom game engine, as every proper programmer should, and then we realize – what the hell I am doing? This shit again??? The same behavioral pattern<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> (last time we swore we’d never do it again, that next time we’d be more careful) occured:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hmmm, lets focus on rendering pipeline. I would be nice to see something on screen finally.</li>
  <li>But, it’s good idea start working on ECS, good designed, good optimized, it will be a solid foundation I can rely and build upon as develompent progresses.</li>
  <li>This seems as I will finish skeleton of my ECS in no time, but,… wait a minute … for optimized ECS<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> is killer using std::vector, there will be better fitter container</li>
  <li>So, I am writting my implementation of PagedVector<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and sudenly realize: I need my custom verbose implementation of zip function to iterate through multiple containers<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</li>
  <li>Hmm, this is another relatively common feature, it should not be in my game engine project. It should be in my own templated STL library.</li>
  <li>When I am creating my custom library, I should made it well and fill some technical gaps in my skills.</li>
  <li>I got clang-tidy, clang-format, docker, CI/CD, only conan is missing now.</li>
  <li>When I created multiple libs. I should learn what is plugin, and how make them with conan. And why.</li>
  <li>WHY THE FUCK I am writing a Plugin manager? I though I want just create simple game.</li>
  <li>I should learn from my mistake, again.</li>
  <li>Now I am working out, how create devblog on github pages and fine tunne this post.</li>
</ul>

<p>How deep the rabbit hole goes?<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Do you premature optimize as well?</p>

      <p><a href="https://peterino.com/Paged%20Vector.html">PagedVector</a> is data structure that under the hood relies on const size arrays. <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>I stole and canibalized this example, even next sentence. By the way this is a longer footnote and i think it is still pretty cool, even prettier than shortier ones even though it does not say anything useful but whatever. <a href="#fnref:8" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
